# Lines of Mercy — README

## Introduction
**Lines of Mercy** is a narrative-driven third-person detective adventure built within Unity.  
Set in a noir-inspired world of organized crime, interrogation, and branching choices, the game focuses on an immersive atmosphere, NPCs empowered by AI, and smart player-driven decision-making.

Developed as part of Full Sail University’s **Project & Portfolio Capstone**, the team follows Scrum, sprint cycles, and multi-phase milestone delivery.  
Our goal is to produce a fully functional prototype featuring core gameplay systems, interactive dialogue powered by AI, and a cohesive UI/UX identity.

By the end of the **Alpha milestone**, the project will establish:

- A cohesive user experience  
- Core scene navigation  
- Foundational architecture for interactable items and NPC logic  
- A style direction for future visual and narrative expansion
