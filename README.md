## Roadmap

### Pre-Alpha (Completed)
- Third-person player movement and camera control  
- Dialogue System integration (Pixel Crushers / Yarn Spinner)  
- Typed player input capture  
- Base NPC interaction logic  
- Initial dialogue flow and branching structure  
- Early scene layout and navigation  

### Alpha (Completed)
- AI integration pipeline (player input → AI analysis → NPC response)  
- Tone, intent, confidence, and target detection from typed input  
- Karma system foundations (Mercy vs Ruthlessness, Mob vs Police)  
- AI-to-dialogue-variable handoff (DSU variable binding)  
- Interactable NPC conversations with typed + choice-based input  
- **AI-driven NPC responses that reflect:**
  - Player tone and intent  
  - NPC role (cop, mob, civilian)  
  - Current relationship and karma state  

### Beta (Current Focus)
- **Working prototype scene(s) supporting interrogation-style gameplay**  
- NPC persona construction (personality, tone, role-based response rules)  
- AI responses aligned to NPC personas and narrative context  
- Expanded interrogation flow (pressure, deflection, escalation)  
- Deeper Karma impact on dialogue outcomes and NPC behavior  
- Dialogue pacing, clarity, and presentation improvements  
- Visual polish pass (lighting, UI refinement, animations as available)  
- Audio pass (ambient sound, UI feedback, basic SFX)  

### Release Candidate (Planned)
- Multiple connected scenes  
- Player choices with longer-term narrative consequences  
- Refined UI/UX and accessibility improvements  
- Performance optimization and stability pass  
- Polished vertical slice suitable for presentation and portfolio review
